         It all started in grade 12, during one of those long after-school hangouts in the garage. As a group of friends, we’d always had big dreams and a shared love for streetwear. By then, we’d already tried our hand at a bunch of business ideas. We’d sold everything from Hot Wheels collections to thrifted clothes, flipping whatever we could to make some extra cash. But none of those ventures really felt like us.

One day, someone tossed out the idea: “What if we started our own clothing line?”

That sparked something different. We all loved streetwear and were tired of seeing brands that didn’t reflect the style we wanted or were way too expensive. We decided to call it Nowadaze—a name that captured how we saw the world: bold, creative, and always evolving.

With the money we’d saved from our past ventures—Hot Wheels profits, thrift flips, and even birthday cash—we found a small local manufacturer who could bring our designs to life. Each of us had a role: one worked on designs inspired by graffiti and the energy of city streets, while another focused on managing orders and marketing. Social media became our platform to build hype, tease designs, and connect with potential customers.

Our first collection wasn’t perfect, but it sold out in days. Seeing people at school and around the neighborhood rocking Nowadaze gave us a rush like nothing before. Late nights in the garage became our norm—debating designs, strategizing new drops, and dreaming bigger every day.

Looking back, those earlier ventures taught us the grind and hustle we needed to succeed. Nowadaze wasn’t just about making money anymore—it became proof that a group of grade 12 students could turn their passion into something real.

And this time, it felt like we were finally building something that was truly ours.
